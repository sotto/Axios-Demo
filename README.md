[Demo Link](https://dbilgili.github.io/Axios-Demo/build/index.html)

This repository is a quick Axios demo for fetching data from _www.randomuser.me_ server.

The search functionality filters the fetched data in accordance with user input and displays the results accordingly.

In this example you will also find the use case of a higher order components (HOC), which handles the page loading phase.

After cloning, run `yarn install` to fetch the required modules and then `yarn start` to initialize the local server.

Make sure you have **NodeJS** installed.
